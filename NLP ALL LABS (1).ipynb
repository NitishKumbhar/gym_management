    "Hello everyone, my name is Anshu Kumar. So the topic is the first day in Sion. Obviously on the first day I had to be late. Because obviously I woke up late. I had to choose the long way through the highway. I reached for his plate. It was very embarrassing being the last person to enter the seminar hall. But it was very fun because I met few people outside the seminar hall and they are my great friends now. Seeing all the new faces, the realization and the reality hit me at that point. Making me realize that this is a new chapter of my life that I'll be starting with a lot of new people. And all the people that I've met till now, they're very close to me. I didn't realize on the first day that they would be so close to me, but I'm really glad. Starting my first day in SRIYAM was one of the best experiences that I could ever have. Seeing all the new people, meeting all those amazing teachers, having such great seminars and telling them about the specialization that they are supposed to choose, it was really amazing. So I am really glad that my first day has come. So thank you so much. Hi guys, my name is Pawan. So my first day at the CUM college, I came to the college for the first time after Corona. So it was difficult for me to attend the session. I met a few of the students in the class. I met one of my students, his name is Nathan, so we can talk here. We can interact with each other, so that way we will make a good friend of each other in our college. This lecture was not going on very well, so we enjoyed it. After that we will get a lunch break also. Hello everyone, hello guys. I am Amit Deshbhattar, coming from Jinnah 2. It was my first day in the school. That's very embarrassing for me. Attending offline classes is very, very difficult for me to attend the offline sessions. After a long duration of gap, I have to attend offline classes and face my friends and teachers. That's very scary for me. And that first day, Akshita Ma'am was very taunting on me, targeting me as a new adult for my first day. She just tried to convince me that you have an uncomfortable zone and you just attend a class and focus on it. Everything is very good for that kind of things. Hello, my name is Sanket Patil. I am from Mandagar. My topic here is the first day of in my college. My college name is Seon. The first day was very amazing. Just I have been to the college, there was no one. I never knew. There was only new faces. But there was one friend, Usha Lee, who has met me. Just first time I have met her. And I have met other people of my college. At 9 p.m. we have met everyone. After that, all of them were busy in their work, busy in their schedules because the college had already been started. So I was not able to capture the movements of the college, what had been done. So I will meet all, make many new friends till now. Now I am, my best way of the Siong is friend, mates feeling. Good afternoon friends, my name is Rohit Gajalangadgi. I am from Baramati and my topic is first day in Siong. Basically I have changed many schools so it was not embarrassing or something very strange for me. First of all I changed 5 schools. So coming in Siong it was a nice experience for me. I changed my school from Delhi to Amritsar and from Baramati. So I came from Baramati for the first day. I reached here at 9 p.m. It was very energetic and energetic that we came after two years in the college. We were at home for two long years. It was very nice to see the college offline. So that we came through many new friends and new teachers. So it was very energetic and charming for me being in this college for the first day. Thank you.\" \"We have a topic on relationship. Everyone when they talk about relationship, everyone thinks about boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. But for me, it is mother and daughter, father and daughter, brothers, sisters and friends. In relationship there must be trust, love and calmness. And one should listen to others and even in times when they get into fight, we should say sorry. Even if we are not feeling sorry or we are not wrong, but to sustain a relationship, we should say sorry. We get involved and a man cannot live without relationships. So we have to maintain our relationships with everyone, with our colleagues, with our friends, with our families, and everyone, which we can live happily with them and we can spend time with them and enjoy with them. Being in a relationship, being interconnected with another person, there should be a relation or a bonding plan that makes a relationship. Relationship need not simply have to be a... If you have a bad relationship, can anybody recommend you on being a teacher and a student? Can they be your companions? The importance of relational awareness is that we have in our life or a good relationship with a person. We can stand up and say that I have a good and healthy relationship with that person. I have a good communication with that person. And honestly the relationship with that person is just like a good relationship. As I said that being in a healthy relationship is important and being a person, maintaining that relationship is even more important. I am Suryakant, today I gave a talk between GD and LCC. LCC is important in every person, they are a help to each other. and I come in the first time in Kodi. When I was in college, I came in the education of relationship.

At that time, I was hanging out with him. I made a relationship with him. I had good friends and a good teacher in Sivam College. I made a healthy relationship with everyone. In a relationship, it is most important to be with every person, for every culture in society to find inner people or in relationship to boost goodwill and objective of communication and help to each other. Hello, my name is Shubham and talking about relationship.

And we have to respect each other's opinions The worm I saw a worm the other day, after rain, crawling with astounding strength, directed by an inner eye towards a drier place. It moved so straight, O God! to think that I, by such absurd and devious routes, should reach my destination. Is there anywhere a worm blinder than I have been, approved so monstrously incapable of being just itself, enduring rain, moving on, secure in dust's ingrained vitality, strategic as if worm and therefore free, then in bitterness I crushed the worm, sadly determined not to honour more, its easy mocking decree. So now it's dead, pretty worm, where is your strength? The God who made you to be wiser than the cunning subtleties within my brain shall know by this the anger of a man. Only anger can I emulate the worm's directness. I've killed the worm.\"\"Hello everyone, my name is Girish and today our topic is watching a sunset. So watching a sunset, I feel like everyday is coming with a new feeling. Watching sunset gives us a thought that what happened in our today and what comes in next day, that's all I think watching sunset. It also gives me a pleasant feeling, how my next day will come and that's all I think. Thank you. Hello guys, my name is Saidi Katmare and watching sunset, Sunset is the most beautiful part of the day because after all the daily chores you do and all the routine, watching the sunset makes your mind a bit calm and makes you think about whatever you have done through the day and lets you analyze and think about the next day coming or to let yourself give a moment and have a self time. According to me it is the best time. Watching sunset wherever it gives me pleasure. \n",
